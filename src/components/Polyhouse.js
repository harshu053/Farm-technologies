  <div className='   my-5 container'>
      <p className='ply'>A greenhouse or polyhouse can be defined as a house or a structure made of transparent material like glass or polyethylene wherein plants are grown under well-controlled climatic conditions. The size of structure varies from small sheds to industry-sized buildings according to the purpose. Primarily, a greenhouse is a glass house whose interiors grow warmer when exposed to sunlight as the house blocks the greenhouse gas to exit. Therefore, while it may be cold outside the temperature is survival friendly and warm for the plants growing inside. Some greenhouses using high-end technology have installed equipment like heating and cooling system, lighting, screening installations and even computerized facilities to provide optimal growth conditions for the plants. This is done especially to reduce the risks of crop loss in greenhouse cultivation.</p>

        <h5 className="text-center borderbottom card-title">Difference Between Greenhouse and Polyhouse</h5>
        <p className="card-text">Greenhouse is made of some kind of transparent material to create a microclimate inside the house. Different materials like glass, wood, polyethylene etc. are used as greenhouse cover to create the microclimate.</p>

        <p className="card-text">Polyhouse is one type of green house where polyethylene is used as the cover. In India, polyhouse farming is the most popular greenhouse technology for itâ€™s low cost of construction. Lath house is another greenhouse technology where wood is used as the cover.</p>

        <p className="card-text">Poly house is economical compared to glass house or greenhouse but the later is more durable than polyhouse.</p>

  <h3 className='  my-5  borderbottom'>Design of Greenhouse</h3>
  <p className=' '>A greenhouse is designed based on environmental conditions of the site and those required for plant growth in polyhouse farming. Taking into consideration the Indian climatic conditions, multi-span, Quonset type greenhouse is the most preferred. It is economical and can be easily constructed. For naturally ventilated greenhouses low density polyethylene films stabilized under UV is used. Some people also use films having a thickness of 200 microns. Screws and nails are not used since the films may get torn off. Instead, they are fastened using T-lock or L-lock. While designing the greenhouse it should be remembered that the structure must bear different types of loads like:
  
  <p className='my-2'><strong>Dead Load:</strong> It is the weight of all the equipment fixed on the frame such as water pipes, service equipment, heating and cooling systems, cladding and the weight of permanent constructions.</p>
  <p className='my-2'><strong>Live Load:</strong> A greenhouse is devised to carry a maximum weight of 15 Kg per square meter. In addition, the roof members must be capable of supporting shelves, hanging baskets, people, etc.</p>
  <p className='my-2'><strong>wind Load:</strong> The structure must have the capacity to withstand 50Kg per square meter of wind pressure.</p>
  <p className=''><strong>Snow Load:</strong> This is considered in areas having snowfall. In case of snow fall, the structure must be able to bear all the different loads in addition to the snow load.</p></p>

<img  style={{width:'60%'}} className=' poly1 my-5' src="./images/pc.jpg" alt="" />

<div>
  <h4 className='  my-5  borderbottom'>Orientation of Greenhouse</h4>
  <p>The orientation of greenhouse depends on the shadow movement, shading effect, type of temperature control, wind direction and latitude. In case of other greenhouses nearby, the orientation should be such that its shadow does not fall on other greenhouses. For this purpose, they are oriented in an East to West direction.</p>
</div>

<div>
  <h4 className='  my-5  borderbottom'>Dimensions</h4>
  <p>To decide the dimensions, a host of factors like size of the greenhouse, wind effects, height, spacing between the greenhouses and its structural design must be considered.</p>
</div>

<div>
  <h4 className='  my-5  borderbottom'>Wind Effects</h4>
  <p>The length of the greenhouse must be perpendicular to the direction of the wind. In case of fan and pad arrangement, the direction of natural wind must be the same as that of the air blown by the fan.</p>
</div>

<div>
  <h4 className='  my-5  borderbottom'>Size of Polyhouse</h4>
  <p>A bigger greenhouse would have more temperature build-up especially if there is no proper ventilation. In case of naturally ventilated greenhouse, the length must not exceed 60m.</p>
</div>

<div>
  <h4 className='  my-5  borderbottom'>Spacing between Greenhouses</h4>
  <p>There should be a distance of 10-15m between two greenhouses. This is to avoid shadow from falling on each other. In addition, the exhaust from one greenhouse must not enter the other greenhouse.</p>
</div>


<div>
  <h4 className='  my-5  borderbottom'>Height</h4>
  <p>A 50m X 50m greenhouse can attain a maximum height of 5m. A taller greenhouse would have larger wind load for the glazing and structure.</p>
</div>

<div>
  <h4 className='  my-5  borderbottom'>Structural Design</h4>
  <p>The structure of the greenhouse must be able to bear all the different loads. Hence, the column, foundation and truss must be designed accordingly. They must follow the guidelines specified by the National Greenhouse Manufacturers Association (NGMA of US) standards.</p>
</div>

 
<div>
  <h4 className='  my-5  borderbottom'>Components for Greenhouse</h4>
  <p>The different components of a greenhouse are:</p>
  <p><strong>Roof:</strong>  It is the transparent overhead cover of the greenhouse.</p>
  <p><strong>Gable:</strong> The wall of the greenhouse is called gable which is transparent.</p>
  <p><strong>Gutters:</strong> Gutters collect and drain out the snow and rain water that is gathered between the spans.</p>
  <p><strong>Column:</strong> It is vertical structure that carries the greenhouse.</p>
  <p><strong>Ridge:</strong>  It is the horizontal section on top of the roof.</p>
  <p><strong>Bracings:</strong>  Bracings are erected to support the structure against wind.</p>
  <p><strong>Arches:</strong> They are the structures that support the covering materials.</p>
  <p><strong>Foundation Pipe:</strong> Foundation pipes connect the structure to the ground.</p>
</div>

<div>
  <h4 className='  my-5  borderbottom'>Watering System in Polyhouse Farming</h4>
  <p>Drip irrigation is the best technique for watering the greenhouse plants owing to the small root system. It must be ensured that the water is dispersed at the root area only and that it does not fall on the leaves or flowers. Falling on leaves and flowers may lead to infection, disease spread and even scorching. Water is forced out through the nozzles under very high pressure through the micro-sprinklers. These sprinklers are arranged at a height of 1 foot above ground level so as to ensure that water is dispersed at the basal part of the plants.</p>
</div>

<div>
  <h4 className='  my-5  borderbottom'>Maintenance of Greenhouse</h4>
  <p>The chief expense of greenhouse is the maintenance of the transparent films. The biofilm on the walls and roof must be washed periodically since dust settles on them reducing the light transmittance. The greenhouse must be solarized annually. Solarization is done by mulching and the interiors are fumigated. Biological control of insects or installation of insect traps is mandatory in greenhouse agriculture. The pipes and sprinklers of the irrigation system must be cleaned periodically so as to prevent accumulation of microbes that may lead to infection in plants. If following organic farming then extra care should be taken.</p>
</div>

<div>
  <h4 className='  my-5  borderbottom'>Problems in Greenhouse Farming</h4>
  <p>Since plants are being cultivated under controlled climatic conditions in a greenhouse, it has its own share of problems too. One of the chief problems is ensuring nutrient availability and protecting the plants from deficiency of various minerals like boron, nitrogen, phosphorous, calcium, iron and potassium. Similarly, plants may also suffer from excess of nutrients. Constant monitoring and soil testing is necessary to ensure that the plants get adequate amount of nutrition and grow properly.</p>
</div>

<div>
  <h4 className='  my-5  borderbottom'>Conclusion</h4>
  <p>reenhouse farming in India may seem a costly and intimidating affair. However, horticultural departments and state governments provide subsidies to encourage polyhouse farming among farmers. Approaching them with a detailed project report containing details like production technology, cost components, margin, etc. would facilitate the process.</p>
